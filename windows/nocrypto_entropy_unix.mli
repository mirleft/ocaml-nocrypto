(** {b RNG} seeding on {b Unix}.

    This module provides one-shot RNG seeding from the Unix kernel RNG,
    typically {[/dev/urandom]}.

    Calling {{!initialize}initialize} is enough to bring the RNG into a working
    state.

    [initialize] is idempotent as long as the default generator is unchanged.
    It is harmless to call it several times.

    If you are using {b lwt}, conside using {!Nocrypto_entropy_lwt} as this
    module allows for continuous reseeding.

    Unless you want to recover from an unlikely case of missing system RNG, the
    recommended way to prime the RNG is to invoke [initialize] at the module
    level:

{[let () = Nocrypto_entropy_unix.initialize () ]}

(** {1 Default generator initialization} *)

val initialize : unit -> unit
(** Seeds the current defalt generator from the system RNG device if it is
    currently unseeded.

    This is the closest thing to {!Random.self_init} and is a good way to prime
    the RNG. *)

(** {1 Manual seeding} *)

val sys_rng : string
(** Detected system RNG device. *)

val read_cs : int -> Cstruct.t

val reseed : ?bytes:int -> ?device:string -> Nocrypto.Rng.g -> unit
(** [reseed ~bytes ~g] mixes in [bytes] bytes from the system RNG into the
    generator [g].

    [bytes] default to a small value reasonable for periodic reseeding.

    [device] defaults to {{!sys_rng}sys_rng}. *)
